<h1 align="center">NFT Marketplace on Goerli Testnet</h1>

<p align="center">What is the best way for a developer to get started in the crypto world? Since NFT contracts on ethereum are well standardized and do not require knowledge of complex mathematics, this was the perfect topic for me. Using NextJs, Hardhat, TailwindCSS and ipfs, I created a fully functional marketplace. One can create, store, sell and compete against others within a ranking of NFTs. 
Have fun!</p>
